# StriverSheet 🚀

C++ implementations of problems from **Striver’s A2Z DSA Sheet**.

This repository is my personal practice log for Data Structures and Algorithms, organised topic-wise.  
The goal is to build **strong fundamentals** and a **clean revision sheet** that I (and others) can quickly revisit.

---

## 📂 Folder Structure

Current topic-wise folders:

- `Binary Search [1D, 2D Arrays, Search Space]`
- `Know Basic Maths`
- `Learn Important Sorting Technique`
- `LearnBasic Hashing`

Each folder contains C++ solutions for the problems under that particular topic from Striver’s Sheet.

> **Note:** Folder names match the sections from the original Striver A2Z DSA roadmap for easier mapping.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Language:** C++
- **Paradigm:** Competitive programming / DSA style
- **Compiler:** Any standard-compliant C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`, `clang++`)
